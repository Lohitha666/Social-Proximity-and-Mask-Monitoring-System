# üöÄ Social Proximity and Mask Monitoring System  
## üìå Overview  
The **Social Proximity and Mask Monitoring System** is an AI-powered solution that detects **social distancing violations** and **mask adherence** using **computer vision and IoT**. It processes real-time video feeds to monitor compliance and provides instant alerts to ensure public safety.  

## üöÄ Getting Started  
Follow the steps below to download, set up, and run the project on your local machine.  


# 1Ô∏è‚É£ Prerequisites  
# Ensure you have the following installed:  
- Python 3.8+  
- pip (latest version)  
- OpenCV & TensorFlow for computer vision  
- YOLOv3 or MobileNet (pre-trained model for mask detection)  
- Raspberry Pi (optional for IoT integration)  

# 2Ô∏è‚É£ Clone the Repository  
git clone https://github.com/your-username/repo-name.git  
cd repo-name  

# 3Ô∏è‚É£ Install Dependencies  
pip install -r requirements.txt  

# 4Ô∏è‚É£ Dataset Preparation  
# The system uses an image/video dataset containing mask-wearing individuals and social distancing scenarios.  
# If using a custom dataset, store images in the `data/` directory.  
# Example CSV format:  
# image_path,mask_label,distance_violated  
# "data/img1.jpg", "No Mask", "Yes"  
# "data/img2.jpg", "Masked", "No"  

# 5Ô∏è‚É£ Run the Detection Model  
python detect.py --source video.mp4  
# The system will process live feeds or recorded videos and display alerts.  

# 6Ô∏è‚É£ Deploy as an API (Optional)  
# To serve the model using Flask/FastAPI, run:  
python app.py  
# Then open your browser and go to:  
# http://127.0.0.1:5000/predict?image=your_image.jpg
